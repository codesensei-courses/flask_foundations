# Setup instructions

## 1. Clone this repository

Check out any specific commit you like.

## 2. Create and activate a virtual environment

How to do this depends on your system; depending on your IDE this may not be necessary.

If you don't know how to do this: see my course [Development Environments and Package Management in Python 3](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/python-3-development-environments-package-management)

## 3. Install dependencies

Inside the project, run `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## 4. Run the project

The command for this is `flask --app flashcards run --debug`.

You can now view the project at http://localhost:5000

If this does not work, you are probably not in the correct folder. There's a clip in Module 1 about troubleshooting; try watching that to figure out what went wrong.
